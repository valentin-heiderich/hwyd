### About "How was your day":
"How was your day?" or hwyd.net is exactly what it sounds like. Just hop on the platform and rate 1-5 Stars then look at the average rating today.
If the average rating is just the rating you gave don't worry it works perfectly fine but why the hell should anyone else rate their day?
All ratings are just stored until a new rating on a new day comes in. The rating is stored under a session_id wich is stored the same way.
Have fun :)
